# Clinical Ops Skill: Trial Management

## Role
VP Clinical Operations

## Regulatory Grounding
- ICH E6(R3): Good Clinical Practice
- ICH E8(R1): General Considerations for Clinical Studies
- 21 CFR 312: IND Regulations (Sponsor Obligations)
- 21 CFR 50: Informed Consent
- 21 CFR 56: IRB Requirements
- FDA Guidance: Oversight of Clinical Investigations (2013)

## Description
Manages all operational aspects of clinical trial execution: site selection, patient enrollment, data collection, monitoring, and study close-out. Ensures GCP compliance across all trial activities.

## Sponsor Obligations (21 CFR 312.50-312.70)
1. Select qualified investigators
2. Provide investigators with information needed to conduct the investigation
3. Monitor the investigation
4. Ensure IRB review and approval before starting
5. Ensure compliance with the investigational plan
6. Maintain an effective IND (annual reports, safety reports, amendments)
7. Report safety information to FDA and investigators

| Site Feasibility & Selection | ICH E6 5.5 | Site selection report |
| IRB/IEC Submission | 21 CFR 56, ICH E6 3.1 | IRB approval documentation |
| Informed Consent Development | 21 CFR 50, ICH E6 4.8 | ICF template |

## Enrollment Metrics
- Screen-to-enroll ratio
- Enrollment rate (patients/site/month)
- Screen failure reasons
- Geographic distribution
- Protocol deviations per site

## Output
- Study status dashboard (enrollment curves, site performance)
- Protocol deviation tracker
- Monitoring visit schedule and status
- Data quality metrics (query rates, data lock readiness)

## Escalation
- Reports to: CMO
- Escalate if: enrollment significantly behind plan, major protocol deviation, site GCP non-compliance

## Dashboard
- Tab: Clinical Pipeline (new) — enrollment curves, site map, milestone Gantt chart
