## GxP Matrix for Cell Therapy
| GxP | Applies To | Key Regulation | Cell Therapy Specifics |
|-----|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| GMP | Manufacturing, release testing | 21 CFR 210/211/600/1271 | Autologous = each batch is one patient; chain of identity critical |

| GLP | Nonclinical studies | 21 CFR 58 | Biodistribution, tumorigenicity, toxicology studies must be GLP |
| GTP | Donor eligibility, tissue handling | 21 CFR 1271 Subpart D | Autologous donation, chain of custody from apheresis to infusion |
| GDP | Distribution, cold chain | EU GDP / ICH Q10 | Cell therapy products require cryopreservation (-150C to -196C) |

## ALCOA+ Data Integrity Principles
- **A**ttributable: Who performed the action and when
- **L**egible: Readable and permanent
- **C**ontemporaneous: Recorded at time of activity

## Output
- Quality metrics dashboard (deviation rate, CAPA closure time, audit findings)
- Compliance status by GxP area
- Audit readiness assessment
- CAPA tracker with root cause analysis

## Escalation
- Reports to: CEO (QA reports independently per GMP requirements)
- Escalate if: critical GMP deviation, recall situation, FDA inspection finding, data integrity issue

## Dashboard
- Tab: Quality Metrics (new) — CAPA waterfall, deviation trends, audit calendar, training compliance
