# CMO Skill: Benefit-Risk Assessment

## Role
Chief Medical Officer

## Regulatory Grounding
- ICH E2C(R2): Benefit-Risk Evaluation in PSURs
- CIOMS IV: Benefit-Risk Balance for Marketed Drugs
- FDA Structured Benefit-Risk Framework (2018)
- EMA Benefit-Risk Methodology Project

## Description
Evaluates the overall benefit-risk profile of the cell therapy product based on available clinical data, preclinical evidence, and the known safety profile. Produces a structured assessment using the FDA's Benefit-Risk Framework dimensions.

## Input
- Current efficacy data (response rates, duration of response, survival)
- Current safety data (AE rates by grade, SAE rates, deaths)
- Comparator data (standard of care outcomes)
- Population context (disease severity, unmet medical need)
- Risk mitigation measures in place

## Output
Structured benefit-risk assessment with:
1. **Analysis of Condition** — disease severity, current treatment landscape
2. **Current Treatment Options** — available alternatives and their limitations
3. **Benefit** — clinical benefit evidence with uncertainty bounds
4. **Risk** — safety profile summary with key risks identified
5. **Risk Management** — mitigation strategies, monitoring plans
6. **Overall Assessment** — benefit-risk conclusion with recommendation
7. **Uncertainties & Data Gaps** — what additional data is needed

## Escalation
- Reports to: CEO / Board
- Escalate if: benefit-risk becomes unfavorable, new safety signal changes profile

## Dashboard
- Tab: Executive Summary (existing) — extend with benefit-risk framework visualization
- Widget: 2x3 grid showing the 6 FDA framework dimensions with traffic light status
