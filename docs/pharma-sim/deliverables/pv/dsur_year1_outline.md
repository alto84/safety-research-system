## 1. Executive Summary

This Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) covers the first annual reporting period
(15 October 2024 through 14 October 2025) for ALC-19T, an autologous anti-CD19
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy under clinical investigation for the
treatment of refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

**Key findings for the reporting period:**

- **Patient exposure:** Approximately 18 patients infused across three clinical sites
  under a 3+3 dose-escalation design (Dose Levels 1-3 completed; Dose Levels 4-6
  enrollment ongoing at data lock).
- **Serious Adverse Events (SAEs):** A total of [X] SAEs were reported in [X] patients.
  The most common SAEs were Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS, Grade >=3) and
  Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS, Grade >=2). All
  CRS and ICANS events resolved with standard-of-care management.
- **Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs):** [X] SUSARs were
  reported and submitted as expedited IND safety reports per 21 CFR 312.32.
- **Deaths:** No deaths were reported in the DIBL (Development International Birth Date)
  reporting period.
- **Actions taken for safety reasons:** None. No dose modifications, study holds, or
  protocol amendments for safety were required.
- **Signal detection:** No new safety signals were identified beyond the known class
  effects of CAR-T therapy. Disproportionality analysis against FAERS data for
  marketed CAR-T products confirmed that the observed AE profile is consistent with
  the anti-CD19 CAR-T class.
- **Benefit-risk conclusion:** The benefit-risk profile of ALC-19T remains favorable
  for continued development in refractory SLE. The safety profile is consistent with
  the known class effects described in the Investigator's Brochure (IB).

### 2.3 Indication Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease
characterized by autoantibody production and immune complex deposition, leading to
tissue damage in kidneys, skin, joints, and other organs. Patients with refractory SLE
who have failed standard immunosuppressive therapy (including cyclophosphamide,
mycophenolate mofetil, and belimumab) represent an unmet medical need.

Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy depletes CD19-positive B lymphocytes, including autoreactive B
cells and plasmablasts driving autoantibody production. Published case series and early
clinical trials (e.g., Mackensen et al., Nat Med 2022; Muller et al., NEJM 2024) have
demonstrated deep B-cell depletion, seroconversion of anti-dsDNA antibodies, and
durable drug-free remission in SLE patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.

### 2.4 Regulatory Interactions

> findings, no cerebral edema)
> **Causality (Investigator):** Related
> **Expectedness (per RSI):** Expected (ICANS listed in IB as Common)
> **Outcome:** Resolved (Day +8, complete resolution)
>
> **Narrative:**
> A 29-year-old female with refractory SLE and history of CNS lupus received ALC-19T
> at Dose Level 4 following lymphodepleting conditioning. Of note, the patient had a
> history of lupus cerebritis (2 episodes, most recent 18 months prior, fully resolved
> with no residual deficits) and was antiphospholipid antibody positive.
>
> On Day +4 post-infusion, the patient developed word-finding difficulty, with ICE
> (Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy) score dropping from 10 (baseline)
> to 5. No focal motor deficits, seizures, or signs of raised intracranial pressure
> were observed. Brain MRI was obtained and showed no acute findings, no cerebral
> edema, and no evidence of lupus cerebritis reactivation. EEG showed diffuse slowing
> without epileptiform discharges.
>
> The patient had concurrent Grade 1 CRS (fever, managed with acetaminophen) at the
> time of ICANS onset. CRS-associated cytokine elevation was moderate (IL-6: 486
> pg/mL, ferritin: 3,200 ng/mL).
>
> Management included dexamethasone 10 mg IV q6h for 4 doses, with serial ICE scoring
> every 4 hours. ICE scores improved to 7 on Day +6 and returned to baseline (10) on
> Day +8. No tocilizumab was administered (ICANS is not responsive to tocilizumab per
> current consensus guidelines). The patient was monitored with twice-daily
> neurological assessments through Day +14 with no recurrence.
>
> **Assessment:** Grade 2 ICANS is a known and expected class effect of CAR-T therapy.
> The patient's history of CNS lupus was a recognized risk factor noted at enrollment.
> The event resolved completely with corticosteroid management. Imaging excluded lupus
> cerebritis reactivation. This case is being tracked for potential contribution to a
> future analysis of ICANS risk factors in the SLE population (CNS lupus history as a
> predisposing factor). No change to the benefit-risk assessment is warranted.

## 9. Safety Findings

### 9.1 Overview of Adverse Events

During the reporting period, all 18 infused patients experienced at least one adverse
event. The safety profile is consistent with the known class effects of anti-CD19 CAR-T
therapy and the expected toxicities of lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy.

### 9.2 Adverse Events Summary (All Grades, All Causalities)

| Adverse Event (MedDRA PT) | All Grades n (%) | Grade >= 3 n (%) | Median Onset (days) | Median Duration (days) |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Cytokine release syndrome | 15 (83%) | 2 (11%) | +1 (0-4) | 5 (2-9) |
| Pyrexia | 16 (89%) | 0 (0%) | +1 (0-3) | 3 (1-7) |
| Neutropenia | 14 (78%) | 10 (56%) | -1 (pre-infusion) | 14 (7-28+) |
| Thrombocytopenia | 9 (50%) | 3 (17%) | +2 (0-7) | 10 (5-21) |
| Anaemia | 8 (44%) | 2 (11%) | +3 (1-7) | 12 (7-21) |
| ICANS / Neurotoxicity | 4 (22%) | 0 (0%) | +4 (2-7) | 3 (1-6) |
| Hypogammaglobulinaemia | 7 (39%) | 0 (0%) | +28 (14-60) | Ongoing |
| Infections (any) | 5 (28%) | 2 (11%) | +18 (7-45) | 7 (3-14) |
| Febrile neutropenia | 4 (22%) | 4 (22%) | +5 (3-8) | 4 (2-7) |
| Hypotension | 6 (33%) | 1 (6%) | +2 (1-4) | 2 (1-4) |
| Nausea | 8 (44%) | 0 (0%) | 0 (0-2) | 2 (1-4) |
| Fatigue | 12 (67%) | 1 (6%) | +1 (0-7) | 7 (3-21) |
| Headache | 6 (33%) | 0 (0%) | +2 (0-5) | 2 (1-4) |

### 9.3 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) Detail

CRS is the most clinically significant expected adverse event for CAR-T cell therapy.
CRS was graded per the Lee criteria (Lee et al., Blood 2014).

| CRS Grade | n (%) | Management |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Grade 1 (fever only) | 8 (44%) | Supportive care (antipyretics, IV fluids) |
| Grade 2 (hypotension responsive to fluids, low-flow O2) | 5 (28%) | Tocilizumab in 3 patients; supportive in 2 |
| Grade 3 (vasopressors, high-flow O2) | 2 (11%) | Tocilizumab + corticosteroids; ICU admission |
| Grade 4 (life-threatening) | 0 (0%) | N/A |
| Grade 5 (fatal) | 0 (0%) | N/A |

Median time to CRS onset: Day +1 (range: Day 0 to Day +4)
Median CRS duration: 5 days (range: 2-9 days)
All CRS events resolved completely with protocol-specified management.

### 9.4 ICANS / Neurotoxicity Detail

ICANS was graded per the ASTCT consensus grading (Lee et al., Biol Blood Marrow
Transplant 2019).

| ICANS Grade | n (%) | Features |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Grade 1 (ICE 7-9) | 2 (11%) | Mild word-finding difficulty |
| Grade 2 (ICE 3-6) | 2 (11%) | Moderate encephalopathy, no motor findings |
| Grade 3 (ICE 0-2, seizure, focal deficit) | 0 (0%) | N/A |
| Grade 4 (prolonged seizure, cerebral edema) | 0 (0%) | N/A |

All ICANS events occurred in the context of concurrent CRS. No cerebral edema was
observed. All events resolved completely with corticosteroid management.

### 9.5 Cytopenias

Cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia) were common and largely attributable
to lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide). Prolonged
cytopenias (defined as Grade >= 3 lasting > 30 days post-infusion) were observed in 3/18
patients (17%), all involving neutropenia.

All patients with prolonged neutropenia received G-CSF support per protocol and recovered
by Day +42 (latest recovery).

### 9.6 Infections

| Infection Type | n (%) | Grade >= 3 | Pathogen (where identified) |
|----------------|-------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Upper respiratory tract infection | 2 (11%) | 0 | Rhinovirus (1), not identified (1) |
| Pneumonia | 1 (6%) | 1 | Pseudomonas aeruginosa |
| Urinary tract infection | 1 (6%) | 0 | E. coli |
| CMV reactivation (viremia) | 1 (6%) | 0 | Monitored; resolved without treatment |

All patients received antimicrobial prophylaxis per protocol (acyclovir,
fluconazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). IVIG replacement was initiated in patients
with IgG < 400 mg/dL per protocol.

### 9.7 Hypogammaglobulinaemia and B-cell Aplasia

B-cell aplasia (CD19+ cells < 1/uL) was achieved in 17/18 patients (94%) by Day +28 and
is an expected pharmacodynamic effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy. Consequent
hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG < 500 mg/dL) was observed in 7/18 patients (39%), managed
with IVIG replacement per protocol.

### 9.8 Dose-Relationship Analysis

| Dose Level | n | Any CRS (%) | CRS >= Gr3 (%) | Any ICANS (%) | ICANS >= Gr2 (%) |
|------------|---|------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| DL1 (0.5 x 10^6/kg) | 3 | 2 (67%) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| DL2 (1.0 x 10^6/kg) | 3 | 2 (67%) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| DL3 (2.0 x 10^6/kg) | 3 | 3 (100%) | 0 | 1 (33%) | 0 |
| DL4 (5.0 x 10^6/kg) | 6 | 5 (83%) | 1 (17%) | 2 (33%) | 2 (33%) |
| DL5 (10.0 x 10^6/kg) | 3 | 3 (100%) | 1 (33%) | 1 (33%) | 0 |

A trend toward increased CRS severity and ICANS incidence was observed at higher dose
levels (DL4-DL5), consistent with dose-dependent CAR-T cell expansion and cytokine
release. This dose-response relationship supports the 3+3 dose-escalation design and
will inform RP2D selection.

## 10. Signal Detection and Evaluation

### 10.1 Methodology

Signal detection for ALC-19T employs a multi-source approach as described in the
Pharmacovigilance Plan:

1. **Quantitative signal detection:** Disproportionality analysis using Proportional
   Reporting Ratio (PRR) and Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) applied to FAERS data for the
   anti-CD19 CAR-T class (marketed products: Yescarta, Kymriah, Tecartus, Breyanzi).
   Signal thresholds: PRR > 2.0, chi-squared > 4.0, N >= 3 reports.

2. **Cross-source triangulation:** Comparison of FAERS spontaneous reporting rates with
   enrollment-weighted average AE rates from ClinicalTrials.gov trials for CAR-T
   products (as implemented in the Safety Research System signal triangulation module).
   Divergence flags: aligned (<25%), moderate (25-75%), significant (>75%).

3. **Clinical trial review:** Systematic review of all AEs in ALC19T-SLE-001 against
   the Reference Safety Information, with assessment of biological plausibility,
   temporal relationship, dose-response, and dechallenge/rechallenge.

4. **Literature surveillance:** Ongoing monitoring of published case reports, clinical
   trial publications, and regulatory communications for anti-CD19 CAR-T products.

### 10.2 FAERS Class-Level Comparison

Based on FAERS data extraction (source: openFDA API; extraction date: 08 February 2026),
the following reporting rates were observed across marketed anti-CD19 CAR-T products:

**Note:** FAERS reporting rates are not incidence rates. They reflect voluntary
spontaneous reporting and are subject to reporting biases (stimulated reporting, Weber
effect, notoriety bias). Direct comparison between FAERS rates and clinical trial
incidence has inherent limitations.

### 10.3 Signal Triangulation Results

Cross-source triangulation comparing FAERS rates with ClinicalTrials.gov enrollment-
weighted rates revealed the following:

- **CRS:** FAERS and trial rates are broadly aligned for the class. No divergence signal.
- **ICANS:** FAERS reporting rates for Yescarta and Tecartus are moderately higher than
  trial-weighted averages, likely reflecting product-specific differences in CAR
  construct (CD28 vs. 4-1BB costimulation) and indication mix.
- **Infections:** FAERS rates trend lower than trial rates, consistent with known
  under-reporting of infections in spontaneous reporting systems.
- **Cytopenias:** Moderate divergence with FAERS rates lower than trial rates, again
  consistent with under-reporting of laboratory-based AEs in spontaneous systems.

### 10.4 Signal Assessment Summary

| Signal Evaluated | Source | Status | Assessment |
|-----------------|--------|--------|------------|
| CRS in SLE (novel indication) | Clinical trial + literature | Under monitoring | CRS rates in SLE appear lower than in hematologic malignancies. Ongoing evaluation. |
| ICANS with CNS lupus history | Clinical trial (n=1 case) | Under monitoring | One case of ICANS Grade 2 in a patient with prior lupus cerebritis. Insufficient data. |
| Prolonged cytopenias | Clinical trial | Under monitoring | 3/18 patients with Grade >= 3 neutropenia > 30 days. Consistent with class effect. |
| Hypogammaglobulinaemia persistence | Clinical trial | Under monitoring | 7/18 patients; expected on-target effect. Long-term trajectory under evaluation. |
| Secondary malignancy (T-cell lymphoma) | FAERS (class-wide) | Under monitoring | FDA investigating class-wide signal for T-cell malignancies post-CAR-T. No cases in ALC-19T. Follow-up too short. |

**Conclusion:** No new validated safety signals were identified during the reporting
period. All observed adverse events are consistent with the known class effects of
anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy as described in the Reference Safety Information. Several signals
remain under monitoring and will be reassessed in the Year 2 DSUR.

## 11. Overall Safety Evaluation and Benefit-Risk Assessment

### 11.1 Safety Summary

The safety profile of ALC-19T observed during the first year of clinical development is
consistent with the established class effects of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy:

- **CRS** was the most common significant AE (83% any grade, 11% Grade >= 3). All events
  were manageable with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids per protocol-specified
  algorithms. No Grade 4-5 CRS occurred.
- **ICANS** occurred in 22% of patients (all Grade 1-2), consistently in the setting of
  concurrent CRS. All events resolved with corticosteroid management.
- **Cytopenias** were common and largely attributable to lymphodepleting conditioning.
  Prolonged cytopenias (>30 days) occurred in 17% but resolved in all cases.
- **Infections** were observed in 28% of patients, with one Grade 3 event (pneumonia).
  Antimicrobial prophylaxis and IVIG replacement appear effective.
- **No deaths** occurred during the reporting period.
- **No unexpected SUSARs** that would alter the benefit-risk assessment were identified.

### 11.2 Benefit Assessment

While efficacy assessment is not the primary purpose of this DSUR, the following
preliminary efficacy signals support continued development:

- SRI-4 response at 3 months: 12/15 evaluable patients (80%)
- Anti-dsDNA seroconversion (positive to negative): 10/15 evaluable patients (67%)
- Complement (C3/C4) normalization: 11/15 evaluable patients (73%)
- Complete B-cell depletion at Day +28: 17/18 patients (94%)
- Prednisone taper to < 5 mg/day by Month 3: 13/15 evaluable patients (87%)

These preliminary results are consistent with published data from anti-CD19 CAR-T
in SLE (Mackensen et al., Nat Med 2022; Muller et al., NEJM 2024) and suggest
clinically meaningful disease activity control in a refractory population.

### 11.3 Benefit-Risk Conclusion

**The overall benefit-risk profile of ALC-19T remains favorable for continued clinical
development in refractory SLE.** The observed safety profile is consistent with the
expected class effects and manageable with established protocols. Preliminary efficacy
signals are encouraging in a population with significant unmet medical need. No new
risks have been identified that would alter the benefit-risk balance or require changes
to the clinical development program.

**Recommendation:** Continue enrollment in ALC19T-SLE-001 per protocol. No changes to
the study design, dose-escalation scheme, informed consent, or Investigator's Brochure
are required based on the Year 1 safety review. Enhanced monitoring will continue for:
prolonged cytopenias, secondary malignancy, and long-term humoral immunity.

## 12. Summary of Important Risks

### 12.1 Identified Risks

| Risk | Frequency (ALC-19T) | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|---------------------|----------|------------|
| Cytokine Release Syndrome | 83% any grade; 11% Grade >= 3 | Potentially life-threatening | Tocilizumab on-site; ICU availability; CRS grading/management algorithm in protocol |
| ICANS / Neurotoxicity | 22% any grade; 0% Grade >= 3 | Potentially severe | ICE scoring q8h Days 0-10; dexamethasone protocol; neuroimaging as needed |
| Prolonged cytopenias | 56% Grade >= 3 neutropenia; 17% prolonged (>30d) | Serious (infection risk) | G-CSF support; CBC monitoring per protocol; antimicrobial prophylaxis |
| Infections | 28% any; 11% Grade >= 3 | Potentially life-threatening | Antimicrobial prophylaxis (antiviral, antifungal, PJP); IVIG for IgG < 400 |
| Hypogammaglobulinaemia | 39% | Chronic (infection risk) | IgG monitoring monthly; IVIG replacement per protocol |
| B-cell aplasia | 94% | Expected on-target | B-cell monitoring; vaccination guidance post-reconstitution |

### 12.2 Potential Risks (Insufficient Data)

| Risk | Basis | Current Status |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Secondary T-cell malignancy | FDA class-wide investigation (Nov 2023); insertional mutagenesis risk with lentiviral vectors | No cases in ALC-19T; follow-up insufficient (<12 months). Long-term monitoring plan in place (5-year follow-up per FDA guidance). |
| Reactivation of latent infections (HBV, TB) | B-cell depletion and immunosuppression | Screening per protocol (HBV, HCV, HIV, TB). No reactivations observed. |
| Reproductive toxicity | Lymphodepleting conditioning; unknown effects on fertility | Adequate contraception required per protocol. No pregnancies reported. |
| Tumor lysis syndrome | B-cell depletion (theoretical risk in SLE with high autoantibody burden) | Not observed. Lower risk expected in SLE vs. hematologic malignancies. |
| HLH / Macrophage activation syndrome | Cytokine-mediated; overlap with severe CRS | No cases meeting HLH diagnostic criteria. H-Score monitoring in protocol. |

### 12.3 Missing Information

| Area | Description | Plan to Address |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Long-term safety (> 12 months) | No patients have completed 12-month follow-up | Ongoing; 5-year follow-up per FDA CBER guidance for gene therapy products |
| Geriatric patients (> 65 years) | No patients > 65 enrolled (SLE demography) | Will evaluate in Phase II if applicable |
| Pediatric patients (< 18 years) | Excluded from Phase I | Pediatric development plan to be assessed based on Phase I/II results |
| Re-treatment | No patients re-treated | Re-treatment cohort may be added in Phase II |
| Combination with other immunosuppressants | Patients required washout per protocol | Will be evaluated in later development phases |
