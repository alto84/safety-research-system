## 1. Brief Summary

**Product:** Autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy
**Indication:** Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in adult patients with refractory disease
**Phase:** Phase I, First-in-Human (FIH) dose-escalation study
**IND Status:** Active

This IND Annual Report covers the first year of clinical development under IND XXXXXX for an autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of refractory SLE. The product is manufactured from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected via leukapheresis, transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to CD28 and CD3-zeta signaling domains.

During the reporting period, the Phase I first-in-human open-label dose-escalation study (Protocol [XXXX]-001) was initiated. The study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in adult patients with SLE refractory to standard-of-care therapy.

**Expedited Designations:**
- Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation: [Applied/Pending/Granted]
- Breakthrough Therapy designation: [Under consideration]
