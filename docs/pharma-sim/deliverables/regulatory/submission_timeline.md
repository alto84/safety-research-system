## Risk-Adjusted Timeline Scenarios

| Scenario | Impact on BLA Submission | Key Driver |
|----------|------------------------|------------|
| **Base case** | Q2 2030 | On-track enrollment; no clinical holds |
| **Accelerated (RMAT accelerated approval)** | Q4 2029 | Accelerated approval on surrogate endpoint after Phase II; confirmatory trial post-approval |
| **Delayed -- enrollment shortfall** | Q4 2030 (+6 months) | Slow Phase III enrollment; additional sites needed |
| **Delayed -- clinical hold** | Q2 2031 (+12 months) | Clinical hold due to safety signal; 6-month resolution |
| **Delayed -- CMC comparability** | Q4 2030 (+6 months) | Manufacturing process change requires bridging study |
| **Delayed -- Phase III futility** | Program termination | Interim analysis shows insufficient efficacy |

---

## Critical Path Items

1. **RMAT/Breakthrough designation decision** -- Impacts regulatory strategy, review timeline, and potential accelerated approval
2. **Phase I safety profile** -- Any unexpected SAEs could delay dose escalation and Phase II start
3. **Manufacturing scale-up** -- Vein-to-vein time and manufacturing success rate are critical for Phase III feasibility
4. **Phase III enrollment rate** -- SLE refractory population is limited; enrollment at ~30 sites is the key timeline driver
5. **EOP2 agreement on Phase III design** -- Misalignment with FDA on endpoints or control arm could add 6-12 months
6. **CMC process changes** -- Comparability between Phase II and Phase III manufacturing must be demonstrated

---

## Dependencies and Assumptions

| Assumption | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|----------------|
| RMAT designation granted | Loss of enhanced FDA engagement and potential accelerated pathway |
| No clinical hold during development | Clinical hold adds 6-12 months minimum |
| Manufacturing success rate >= 90% | Lower rate requires process optimization and delays enrollment |
| Phase III enrollment completes in ~6 months | Each month of enrollment delay shifts BLA by ~1 month |
| FDA agrees to SRI-4 primary endpoint | Alternative endpoint may require additional data or longer follow-up |
| No major GCP findings at sites | Critical findings could require re-monitoring, data cleaning, or site closure |
| Priority Review granted for BLA | Standard review adds 4 months to PDUFA timeline |
