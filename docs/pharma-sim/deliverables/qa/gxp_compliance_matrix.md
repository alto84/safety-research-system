## Purpose

This matrix provides a consolidated view of GxP compliance across the autologous CAR-T cell therapy program. It maps each GxP area to applicable regulations, current implementation status, identified gaps, and prioritized next actions. This is intended to support audit readiness, management review, and regulatory inspection preparation for a Phase I IND-stage startup.

Batch records established for 6 clinical lots. Environmental monitoring program operational. Phase I-appropriate controls in place per FDA Phase 1 CGMP guidance. Process not yet validated (acceptable for Phase I). | 1. Equipment qualification (IQ/OQ/PQ) documentation incomplete for 2 of 7 instruments (controlled-rate freezer, automated cell counter). 2. Cleaning validation not yet initiated for the isolator suite. 3. Annual Product Quality Review (APQR) procedure drafted but not yet executed. 4. Electronic batch record system not yet 21 CFR Part 11-compliant (paper-based system in use). | 1. Complete IQ/OQ/PQ for controlled-rate freezer and cell counter by Q2 2026. 2. Initiate cleaning validation protocol (target: Q3 2026). 3. Execute first APQR after 6th batch release. 4. Evaluate eBR vendor options; target implementation for Phase II readiness. |
| **GCP** (Clinical) | ICH E6(R3) GCP; 21 CFR 312 (IND regulations); 21 CFR Part 50 (Informed Consent); 21 CFR Part 56 (IRB); ICH E8(R1) (General Considerations for Clinical Studies) | **Partial -- Operational.** IND active. Phase I protocol approved by FDA and IRB. 3 clinical sites initiated. Informed consent covers leukapheresis, conditioning chemotherapy, CAR-T infusion, and 15-year long-term follow-up per FDA gene therapy guidance. EDC system operational. Safety monitoring committee (SMC) charter executed. | 1. Source data verification (SDV) plan not yet fully implemented at 1 of 3 sites (Site 003, recently activated). 2. Long-term follow-up (LTFU) tracking system not yet built; currently tracked manually. 3. Protocol deviation log shows 2 deviations in first 4 patients -- trending analysis needed. 4. No formal risk-based monitoring plan per ICH E6(R3) -- currently using 100% SDV approach. | 1. Complete site initiation monitoring visit at Site 003 (scheduled Q1 2026). 2. Implement LTFU database (15-year tracking per FDA guidance for gene therapy products). 3. Conduct protocol deviation trend analysis after 6th patient enrolled. 4. Develop risk-based monitoring plan per ICH E6(R3) by Q2 2026. |
| **GLP** (Nonclinical) | 21 CFR 58 (GLP for Nonclinical Lab Studies); FDA Guidance: Preclinical Assessment of Investigational Cellular and Gene Therapy Products (2013) | **Complete for IND-enabling studies.** GLP toxicology study (single-dose murine model) completed at contract research organization (CRO). GLP biodistribution study completed (qPCR-based). Tumorigenicity assessment included in IND submission. Study reports archived. QA audits of CRO completed pre-study and during in-life phase. | 1. Insertional mutagenesis risk assessment referenced published data only -- no product-specific integration site analysis performed. 2. Carcinogenicity study not yet planned (may be required for BLA depending on Phase I data). 3. CRO audit findings (2 minor) from pre-study audit still open in CAPA system. | 1. Evaluate need for product-specific integration site analysis (lentiviral vector); engage genomics CRO by Q3 2026. 2. Develop nonclinical strategy for Phase II/III and BLA per FDA pre-BLA meeting plan. 3. Close CRO audit CAPA items (CAPA-2025-003, due Q1 2026). |
| **GTP** (Tissue Handling) | 21 CFR 1271 Subparts C and D (Donor Eligibility and GTP); PHS Act Section 351 (Biological Product Licensing) | **Partial -- Operational.** Donor eligibility determination procedures established for autologous setting per 21 CFR 1271.50. Chain of identity (COI) labeling system implemented (ISBT 128). Tissue handling SOPs cover leukapheresis receipt, inspection, and transfer to manufacturing. Tissue tracking from collection through infusion documented per batch. | 1. COI system is manual (label-based); no electronic COI tracking yet. 2. No formal procedure for handling COI discrepancies or mix-up investigations. 3. Tissue storage area qualification (temperature mapping) due for annual requalification. 4. Autologous donor eligibility re-assessment procedure not yet tested for serology-reactive donors. | 1. Evaluate electronic COI tracking systems (e.g., TrakCel, Vineti) for Phase II scale-up. 2. Draft SOP for COI discrepancy investigation and patient safety hold (Q1 2026). 3. Execute annual temperature mapping of tissue storage (LN2 tanks, -80C freezers) by Q2 2026. 4. Develop procedure for managing serology-reactive autologous donors (per 21 CFR 1271.90). |
| **GDP** (Distribution / Cold Chain) | EU GDP Guidelines (2013/C 343/01); ICH Q10 (Pharmaceutical Quality System); FDA Guidance: Current Good Tissue Practice (for chain of custody); IATA DGR (shipping classification) | **Partial -- In Development.** Cryopreserved product shipped in validated dry shippers (-150C to -196C). Temperature monitoring via data loggers. Shipping qualification performed for primary shipping lane (manufacturing site to Site 001). Chain of custody documentation maintained per shipment. Courier qualified. | 1. Shipping validation incomplete for 2 of 3 clinical sites (Sites 002 and 003). 2. No excursion management SOP for shipping temperature deviations. 3. Backup shipping lane not yet qualified. 4. Return shipment process for unused product not yet defined. 5. Data logger calibration certificates not centrally tracked. | 1. Complete shipping lane validation for Sites 002 and 003 by Q1 2026. 2. Draft and approve excursion management SOP (Q1 2026; see CAPA-2026-001). 3. Qualify backup courier and shipping lane by Q2 2026. 4. Develop unused product return/destruction procedure. 5. Implement calibration tracking for all shipping data loggers. |

## Compliance Summary

| GxP Area | Overall Compliance Rating | Phase I Readiness |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| GMP | Amber -- Partial | Acceptable for Phase I per FDA 2008 guidance |
| GCP | Amber -- Partial | Operational; risk-based monitoring upgrade needed |
| GLP | Green -- Complete | IND-enabling studies complete and archived |
| GTP | Amber -- Partial | Operational; electronic COI system needed for scale-up |
| GDP | Red -- In Development | Functional for Site 001; gaps at Sites 002/003 |

**Rating Key:**
- **Green:** Compliant; no critical gaps. Inspection-ready.
- **Amber:** Partially compliant; gaps identified but manageable for current phase. Remediation in progress.
- **Red:** Significant gaps requiring immediate action before expansion.
