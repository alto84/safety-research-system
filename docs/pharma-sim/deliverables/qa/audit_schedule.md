## Purpose

This schedule defines the annual audit program for the cell therapy program. The audit program is designed to ensure each GxP-critical functional area is audited at least once per calendar year, in accordance with ICH Q10 (Pharmaceutical Quality System) and 21 CFR 211.180(f) requirements. Vendor audits are conducted based on criticality assessment per the Supplier Qualification SOP (QA-SOP-012).

Scope covers compliance with ICH E6(R3) and 21 CFR 312. | 2026-01-13 to 2026-01-15 (3 days) | Lead Auditor: QA Manager; Subject matter expert: Regulatory Affairs representative | **Completed** | **3 findings total:** 0 Major, 2 Minor, 1 Observation. **Minor (F-2026-002-01):** Protocol deviation PD-2026-001 (infusion timing) was reported to the IRB within the required window, but the internal deviation log was not updated until 5 business days after the event (SOP requires 2 business days). **Minor (F-2026-002-02):** Trial Master File (TMF) at sponsor level missing 3 of 42 expected essential documents per ICH E6(R3) Appendix (site training log for Site 003, delegation log update for Site 001, monitoring visit report for Site 002 Visit 3). **Observation (O-2026-002-01):** Risk-based monitoring approach not yet implemented; current 100% SDV model is resource-intensive and not aligned with ICH E6(R3) principles. Recommend developing risk-based quality management plan. **CAPA raised:** None (individual corrective actions assigned). Management response submitted 2026-02-01. |
| AUD-2026-003 | Internal | **QC Laboratory** -- Analytical method qualification/validation status, equipment calibration program, reagent and reference standard management, stability program, OOS investigation process, data integrity (ALCOA+ compliance), laboratory notebook practices, USP <71>/<85>/<63> method suitability. | 2026-04-14 to 2026-04-16 (3 days) | Lead Auditor: QA Manager; Co-auditor: QC Director (recused from own area -- external QA consultant to lead) | **Planned** | N/A -- Audit not yet conducted. **Audit focus areas:** (1) Endotoxin testing practices following CAPA-2026-005 (OOS event); (2) Data integrity for instrument-generated data (HPLC, flow cytometer, qPCR); (3) Reagent lot management and expiry tracking; (4) Stability-indicating method status for post-thaw product. **Pre-audit document request** issued 2026-03-01. |
| AUD-2026-004 | Internal | **Data Management / IT Systems** -- EDC system validation, 21 CFR Part 11 compliance assessment (electronic batch records, LIMS, EDC), data backup and disaster recovery, user access controls, audit trails, computerized system validation (CSV) documentation, cybersecurity controls for GxP systems. | 2026-07-21 to 2026-07-23 (3 days) | Lead Auditor: QA Manager; Subject matter expert: IT Systems Administrator; External consultant: CSV specialist | **Planned** | N/A -- Audit not yet conducted. **Audit focus areas:** (1) Part 11 gap assessment for current paper-based batch record system; (2) EDC system (vendor-hosted) qualification documentation review; (3) Flow cytometry data integrity -- raw data file (.fcs) storage, backup, and audit trail; (4) User access review for all GxP systems. **Pre-audit document request** to be issued 2026-06-15. |
| AUD-2026-005 | Vendor / Supplier | **Viral Vector Supplier (Contract Manufacturing Organization)** -- GMP compliance for lentiviral vector manufacturing. Scope: facility tour, batch record review for vector lots supplied to program, environmental monitoring data, raw material controls, viral safety testing (RCL, adventitious agents), stability data, change control review, deviation and CAPA trending, regulatory inspection history. | 2026-05-19 to 2026-05-21 (3 days, on-site at vendor facility) | Lead Auditor: Head of QA; Co-auditors: Head of CMC, QC Director | **Planned** | N/A -- Audit not yet conducted. **Audit rationale:** Viral vector is a critical starting material. Supplier was initially qualified via questionnaire and document review (2025). First on-site audit required per Supplier Qualification SOP (QA-SOP-012) within 12 months of first material receipt. **Key areas of concern:** (1) Vector lot-to-lot consistency (titer variability observed in first 3 lots received); (2) RCL testing methodology and sensitivity; (3) Vendor's response to recent FDA Warning Letter to a different client (publicly available -- assess systemic implications). **Pre-audit questionnaire** sent 2026-04-01. |

- **Finding Classification:**
  - **Major:** Systemic failure or significant risk to product quality, patient safety, or data integrity. Requires CAPA.
  - **Minor:** Isolated deficiency that does not pose systemic risk. Requires corrective action with defined timeline.
  - **Observation:** Opportunity for improvement; no regulatory requirement breached. Tracked but no formal corrective action required.
- **Reporting:** Audit reports distributed to area management and CEO within 15 business days of audit close-out. Findings tracked to closure by QA.
